"""Kernel-facing handlers — the Requests that need ``SecondBrainContext``.

Everything here reaches into the context object the kernel supplies: the
database, the conversation runtime, config, services, the tool and command
registries. The guest never touches any of it.

Two conventions run through the file:

- **Ownership is checked, not assumed.** Conversation Requests go through
  ``runtime.assert_conversation_access`` wherever it exists, mirroring the
  kernel's own rule that listing filters are convenience and access checks
  are the real boundary.
- **A missing capability is an ordinary failure.** The kernel is a microkernel;
  the timekeeper, the parser, or a tool registry may simply not be installed.
  Sandboxed code gets a Result saying so, not an exception.

    """Every configured profile, and every backend one could name.

    ``describe()`` has existed since the migration with exactly this row shape
    and no callers at all — it was written for this command and never wired.

    Backends carry their *display* name. A person picking one should read
    "LiteLLM (any provider)", which is what the file declares; the raw class
    name is an implementation detail that leaked all the way into the profile
    card. ``aliases`` comes along because a profile stores whatever backend
    name it was written with, and a migrated backend claims its predecessor's
    name — so a config saying ``LiteLLMService`` has to be resolvable to the
    class that replaced it before it can be displayed.

    A profile row's ``params`` is what that profile adds to every call, as
    resolved rather than as configured: a null-valued entry means "do not send
    this" and is dropped, so a caller rendering it shows what goes on the wire
    rather than what config happens to spell. Nothing is filled *in* — the
    kernel supplied a default reasoning effort once and names no provider
    parameter now, so what a profile sends is what somebody configured.

    Four optional arguments answer the questions a *setup* flow asks, in
    order of narrowing: ``providers`` names the providers a backend can reach,
    ``models`` names what one endpoint serves, ``info`` says what one model is
    and how big its window is, and ``params`` names what that model accepts.
    They grew here rather than becoming four Request types because the subject
    is the same one this type already has — the model registry — and a caller
    needs the ordinary answer alongside them anyway.

    Each answers ``[]`` when nothing can say, which is a real answer and not a
    failure: no backend is obliged to introspect, and the flow that asked
    falls back to a typed value. ``models`` answers from what the backend
    knows offline unless ``live`` is also passed, which lets it ask the
    endpoint and therefore costs egress — never do that from a command's
    ``form``, whose approval has not been evaluated yet and which deadlocks
    on a dialog.

    ``submit`` was given a thread for this reason. ``resolve`` and ``cancel``
    were not, and both reach ``handle_action`` by exactly the same path —
    ``resolve_approval`` and ``cancel`` are ``submit`` with a different action
    type. Answering an approval from an inline button therefore froze the
    transport every time. Hoisted here so a sixth entry point cannot be added
    without inheriting the answer.

    The REPL escaped it by luck rather than design: in ``approving_request``
    it answers through ``submit_text``, which was already detached. It is the
    *bus-driven* approval path — the one a rich frontend with buttons uses —
    that had no protection.

    Returns a Result when the work was detached, or None to run it inline.
    Detaching costs the caller a real answer, so it reports acceptance: see
    ``_frontend_resolve`` for what a frontend should ask instead.

"""The SDK — what sandboxed code imports.

Two kinds of thing live here, and the boundary between them is the whole
design:

- **Requests** (``sdk.fs``, ``sdk.db``, ``sdk.net``, …) yield to the kernel.
  They block, they are classified, they may be refused, and they land in the
  ledger. Each namespace is one Request family, so ``sdk.fs.read`` is the
  ``fs.read`` Request and the catalogue reads as a table of contents for the
  SDK.
- **Helpers** (``sdk.text``, ``sdk.md``) are plain functions running inside
  the sandbox. They cost nothing, need no approval, and never reach the
  kernel.

The test for which is which: *does it touch disk, network, clock, or process?*
If no, it belongs in a helper. If yes, it is a Request.

Plugin code looks like ordinary synchronous Python. The suspend/resume loop is
real, but it lives on the kernel side — the author never writes ``yield``, and
helper functions can make Requests freely without becoming generators.

**Requests return their value and raise when they fail.** That is Python's
answer to an operation that can fail, and it keeps plugin code to the shape
it would have had without a sandbox at all::

    def run(self, sdk, path):
        # Count the words in a file.
        return len(sdk.fs.read(path).split())

No result object to unwrap, no branch to write. If the read fails, the runner
turns the exception into a failed result carrying the reason — which is what
the caller wanted anyway.

Handling a failure is an ordinary ``try``, and refusals have their own class
so "the user said no" can be caught without also swallowing "the disk is
full"::

    try:
        page = sdk.net.http(url)
    except sdk.Denied:
        return "I need permission to fetch that."

Returning is just as plain: return any value and the runner wraps it. Reach
for ``sdk.ok(...)`` only to attach ``llm_summary`` or attachments, and
``sdk.fail(...)`` only to fail without raising.

    escort standing at the ``llm_call`` doorway; ``delta`` is for the backend
    actually placing it. Outside those, there is no call and the Request is
    refused.

    ``list``/``load``/``unload`` are about the *registry* rather than any one
    call: which profiles are configured, which backends could serve them, and
    which are open. Profiles stopped being services when ``service_llm.py``
    was deleted, so asking ``sdk.services`` about them — which is what ``/llm``
    did — reports every profile missing and unloaded while conversations using
    those same profiles work fine.

        Answers ``{"profiles": [...], "backends": [...], "aliases": {...},

        ``endpoint``, ``context_size``, ``params``, ``loaded`` and
        ``sandboxed``; a backend row carries ``name`` and ``display_name``.
        ``params`` is the extra provider kwargs that profile sends on every
        call — reasoning effort and whatever else it configures — as resolved
        rather than as configured: declined params (a ``null`` in the profile)
        are gone, and the names are the ones that go on the wire. Nothing is
        filled *in*; the kernel names no provider parameter, so what a profile
        sends is what somebody configured. ``aliases`` maps a retired
        backend name to the one that replaced it, which is what a stored
        ``llm_service_class`` may still be. Each profile row also carries
        ``param_status`` — ``{param: [supported, note]}`` for the params that
        profile sends, and ``{}`` for a profile whose box is closed, since
        nothing opens one merely to answer this.

        The four optional arguments are the setup questions, narrowing in
        order. Pass ``providers=True`` for the provider list, or
        ``providers=<name>`` for that one provider with its endpoint resolved;
        ``models=<url>``
        (with ``key`` and ``provider``) for what one endpoint serves; or
        ``params=<model name>`` (with ``endpoint``) for what one model takes;
        or ``info=<model name>`` for facts about it, currently its context
        window.
        Each adds a key of the same name to the answer. ``backend`` limits
        any setup question to the selected backend; omit it only when an
        aggregate answer is wanted. ``live`` additionally
        lets ``models`` ask the endpoint rather than answering from what the
        backend knows offline. That is egress, so it is off by default and
        must **never** be set from a command's ``form``: approval is evaluated
        on completed form arguments, so a form runs ungranted and the dialog
        it raises deadlocks against the lock it is holding.

        Every one of them can answer ``[]``, and that is ordinary rather than
        a failure — no backend is obliged to introspect, and a caller handed
        nothing should let the value be typed instead. ``models`` may make a
        live call to the endpoint, so ask it once, at the point an endpoint

    Guest code cannot import ``pathlib`` or ``os.path``: both reach the
    environment, and the validator refuses them. But manipulating a path is
    *computation* — joining, splitting, taking a parent — and by this SDK's own
    test (does it touch disk, network, clock, or process?) that makes it a
    helper, not a Request. Without these, a plugin doing anything path-shaped
    had to concatenate strings by hand and get separators wrong.

    Two things it deliberately does not do, both because they would reach the
    environment and stop being helpers:

    - **No symlink resolution.** ``normalize`` is textual, so two names for
      one file through a link normalize differently. For the caller that
      matters — read-before-edit tracking — that fails toward "not read yet",
      the strict direction.
    - **No current directory.** A relative path with no ``base`` stays
      relative rather than being resolved against a cwd, which inside a box
      is ``sandbox/`` and means nothing to the plugin anyway. Pass the base
      you mean, usually ``sdk.paths.get("project")``.

        that hit a locked file, an HTTP call that timed out and a box that died
        all carry it; a malformed query and a refusal do not. This spends that
        signal, so the common loop is one line::

            page = sdk.retry(lambda: sdk.net.http(url))

        e.code == "not_found"`` to retry something the kernel does not consider
        transient, or ``on=lambda e: False`` to disable retrying entirely
        without changing the call.

        **A refusal is never retried.** Policy is not a transient condition,
        and asking three times is how one dialog becomes three. ``Denied``
        propagates on the first attempt whatever ``on`` says, so a caller can

        deadline this execution was actually given, and the wall ceiling that
        bounds it however it spends the time. ``running`` is ``None`` when
        nothing is enforcing a deadline right now.

        The two numbers differ, and which one bites depends on what the code
        spends its time doing. **Running** time is what a declared ``timeout``

        four minutes inside ``sdk.proc.run`` costs almost nothing against it.
        **Wall** clock is the backstop, and it is not declarable — it is what

        This exists so long work can stop *itself*. Without it the watchdog is
        the only thing that ends a run that has gone on too long, and it ends

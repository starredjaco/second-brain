"""Per-conversation runtime state.

Two dataclasses live here, kept apart from the runtime so each can be read
on its own:

- :class:`RuntimeSession` is the in-memory bag of *everything* the runtime
  needs to reason about a single conversation: the state machine, the
  provider-shaped history list, persistence id, profile pinning, plugin-
  pinned tools, the per-session lock, and the cancel event.
- :class:`RuntimeResult` is the transport-neutral output the runtime hands
  back to a frontend after every action.

        A failure is delivered **once**, on ``error``. It used to be delivered
        three times: ``ActionResult.fail`` sets ``message=err.message`` *and*
        ``error=err``, so the same sentence was appended by both branches below
        and then populated ``error`` as well. Every frontend that rendered both
        kinds printed it twice, and a client had no way to tell the copies from
        two genuinely different things the kernel wanted to say.

        **The failure says what failed.** ``ActionError.to_dict`` answers
        ``{code, message, details, retry_phase}``, which describes the error and
        not the act — so a failing ``/packages install``, an unrecognised slash
        command and "Still working." arrived as the same shape, and a client
        with a command panel had nothing to route on. ``action`` (and ``name``,
        where the act had one) are stamped on here, at the one place that still
        knows both halves.

        ``message`` is still forwarded when there is no error, because that is
        the success one-liner. **Today every one of them is a form or approval
        acknowledging its own navigation** — "Back.", "Skipped.", "Cancelled." —
        so every one is marked ``FORM_NAVIGATION`` and travels on
        ``callable_output``. That is a command reporting on its own progress. On
        ``messages`` it was a line of chat arriving in the transcript every time
        somebody pressed Back in a settings dialog, and the field documentation
        above says outright that nothing but the conversation belongs there.

        The ``messages`` branch is therefore currently unreachable, and is kept
        rather than deleted because it is where a *future* action that genuinely
        speaks in the conversation would belong. Adding one is the deliberate
        act; ``tests/test_message_channels.py`` is what makes it deliberate.

        The mark is ``FORM_NAVIGATION`` in ``data`` rather than a check on the
        action's name, because skipping a form's last field runs the command and
        returns *that* action's result: the acknowledgement outlives the action
        that made it.

        A frontend that does not declare ``supports_callable_output`` still sees
        both, flattened into the chat by ``BaseFrontend`` — so a terminal keeps
        the acknowledgement it depends on, and a structured client gets it
        beside the form it is about.

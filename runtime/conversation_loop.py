"""Drive one participant's turn through cs.enact() until end_turn.

This file is the agent-side equivalent of PokerMonster's `run_game` inner
loop. While turn priority belongs to a participant, repeatedly:
    1. ask the participant for the next action  (`_next_action`)
    2. enact it through the state machine       (`cs.enact(...)`)
    3. translate the action's events back into provider-shaped history rows

There is exactly ONE labeled `cs.enact(...)` call site in this file — inside
`_enact_logged`, the gateway every agent-side enact flows through so the
action ledger records each move (the `end_turn` and over-budget enacts
included).

The class is named `ConversationLoop` (not `AgentMachine`) because the same
shape supports user-user or agent-agent conversations in the future. Today
only the agent path is wired; a user-side `_next_action` would just block
until input arrives.

        Sectioned prompts come in as ``[system_combined, user_context_update]``.
        The system message stays at position 0 (cacheable). The context-update
        message is placed as **its own row immediately before** the latest real
        user turn.

        It used to be prepended into that user row instead, welded onto the
        person's own words. That kept strict role alternation, and it is what
        made the block hardest for a model to read as anything other than
        something the user said — no amount of "not authored by the user" text
        inside a user message undoes the role it arrives in. Its own row at
        least makes the seam visible.

        Two properties survive the change and one does not. The **placement**
        is identical: ``_split_current_turn`` finds the same row, and in an
        agentic run — one user message followed by dozens of assistant and tool
        rows — the block still lands at index 1, ahead of the whole transcript,
        so everything the turn-stable clock and ``turn_prompt_tokens`` exist
        for still holds. **Tool-call adjacency** survives too: the insertion
        point is immediately before a ``user`` row, and no user row ever sits
        between an assistant's ``tool_calls`` and the ``tool`` rows answering
        them. What is forfeited is **strict alternation** — the block and the
        user's message are now two consecutive ``user`` rows. OpenAI-shaped
        APIs accept that; an API that requires alternation does not, and for
        one that also refuses a ``system`` row outside position 0 there is no
        arrangement that satisfies both.

        all**: the last rows are the agent's own tool calls — five successful
        ``spawn_subagent`` results, say — and the next user message simply
        follows. The model reads its own plan back, sees no evidence anything
        ended, and offers to wait for results that were cancelled minutes ago.

        Written here rather than queued on ``session.pending_user_inputs``,
        which was the first attempt and was worse than the problem: that list
        is a *drive trigger*, drained by ``handle_action``'s closing-race
        check into a fresh ``send_text`` — so the notice started a whole new
        agent turn, and one that was no longer cancelled, since the flag is
        cleared on the way out. Recorded on the loop's own thread, at the one
        point the turn is known to be over, it reaches the model at its next
        call and starts nothing.

        One sentence for every cancel, rather than a tailored one: what
        differs between "a tool was running" and "five agents were running" is
        not something the model needs to act on differently, and the branch
        cost a boolean threaded through two files.

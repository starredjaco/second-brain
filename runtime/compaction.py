"""Summarize a conversation's history in place, and say what that cost.

This is the whole of what "compacting" means, in one function with two
callers. The loop's context-safety escort calls it when the context gets
tight (``ConversationLoop._compact``); ``ConversationRuntime.compact_session``
calls it when a person asks for the same thing by typing ``/compact``.

It lives here rather than on the loop because the loop is turn-scoped —
``_active_db`` and ``_active_conversation_id`` are set at the top of
``drive()`` and cleared in its ``finally`` — so a compaction asked for outside
a turn had no way to reach the two things that make it durable: the marker row
and the checkpoint flag. Without those the next turn's
``replace_conversation_messages`` overwrites the full transcript with the
four-row stub this leaves behind.

Nothing here swallows exceptions. The loop's wrapper does, because a turn must
never break over compaction; the command path needs to know what happened, and
a guard that returns silently is indistinguishable from one that worked.

    long enough while holding nothing new: the model call re-summarizes a
    summary, keeps the identical tail, and reports saving nothing.

    Automatic compaction never showed this — it fires on real context
    pressure, which four rows are not — but ``/compact`` twice in a row is a
    thing a person does, and degrading the summary each time is the worst
    version of doing nothing.

    So the question is about the rows a compaction would *drop*: if every one
    of them is already a summary, there is nothing to fold in. One more turn
    of real conversation puts non-bridge rows back in that slice and this

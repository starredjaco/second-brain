"""Running an agent on a prompt, in the background, in its own conversation.

This is kernel routing and nothing else, which is why it lives in the kernel
rather than in a package. Spawning a subagent is ``runtime.iterate_agent_turn``
on a session key that is not the active one — every hard part is about *what
happens around* that call: which conversation it runs in, who is told when it
finishes, and what ends it when it will not end itself.

**A handle, not a table scan.** The store version located a running child by
matching ``payload_json LIKE '%"conversation_id": N,%'`` against ``task_runs``,
because a bus event has no identity to hand back. A spawn has one here, and two
whole mechanisms fall away with it: the side-set of "children the parent already
cancelled" (needed only to suppress a stale completion echo from a run that had
no state of its own) and the second copy of the same query in the barrier.

**One delivery, decided by whoever collects first.** A finished child's report
is stored on its handle and delivered exactly once — by an explicit
``collect``, or by the end-of-turn ``barrier`` for children nobody collected.
The worker never queues it directly, which is what makes ``wait=False`` usable
from a script (no turn to hold open) and from a turn (barrier holds it open)
without the two racing to report the same result twice.

**A deadline is a hard cutoff, never a silent drop.** A child still running at
its deadline is cancelled and reported as failed. The model always learns each
child's fate, because "no news" is indistinguishable from "still thinking" and
an agent that guesses will report findings nobody produced.

"""Adapter-facing conversation runtime.

This is the single dispatcher between a frontend transport (REPL, Telegram,
future event bus) and the state machine. It owns sessions, persistence,
and approvals, but every state-changing decision goes through one labeled
``cs.enact(...)`` site (see :meth:`ConversationRuntime._dispatch`). When
the user's action hands turn priority to the agent, the runtime hands off
to ``ConversationLoop.drive()``, which contains its own labeled
``cs.enact(...)`` site for the agent's moves.

That two-call-site shape mirrors PokerMonster's ``run_game``: one obvious
line where everything flows through, easy to find, easy to read.

How this file is organised
--------------------------

The runtime concerns are split across a small family of modules so each
one is its own readable unit:

- :mod:`state_machine.session` — the ``RuntimeSession`` + ``RuntimeResult``
  dataclasses and the ``SessionConflict`` error.
- :mod:`state_machine.runtime_persistence` — load/save/restore, the
  ``open_session`` unified entry point, and the ``iterate_agent_turn``
  external-driver path.
- :mod:`state_machine.runtime_approvals` — programmatic typed-input /
  approval requests.
- :mod:`state_machine.runtime_config` — per-session profile, scope, tool
  registry, system prompt, and ``ConversationLoop`` construction.
- :mod:`state_machine.runtime_dispatch` — small per-action helpers used
  inside ``_dispatch``.

This file keeps the **runtime story**: the constructor that wires
everything up, the ``handle_action`` entry point, the user-side dispatch
loop, the agent-turn driver, and the plugin-facing API surface. Read
top-to-bottom.

                # The twin case is two branches below and already knew this: a
                # message sent mid-turn raises a ``persist=False`` notification

                # keeps ``callable_output``, because a settings form dismissing

        ask rather than assume.

        loading a different conversation, starting a new one, or being a

        typed at a fresh prompt stamps ``None``, and the plain equality check
        then dropped the mode the instant the user said anything. Silently,
        and in the permissive direction, which is the worst pairing available:
        you set lockdown, the conversation opened, and the next shell command
        raised a dialog as though you had never typed it.

        The rule that fixes it is the one the check was always trying to

        the mode was set is that same piece of work, not another one. So an

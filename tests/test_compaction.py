"""Compaction as an act somebody can ask for.

The loop has always been able to compact; what is new is that ``/compact``
runs the same act outside a turn. Three things have to hold for that to be
worth having:

- every way of doing nothing has a *name*, because the loop discards those
  and a person does not
- the two durable effects — the marker row and the checkpoint flag — land,
  since without them the next turn's ``replace_conversation_messages``
  overwrites the full transcript with the stub compaction leaves behind
- a drive already holding the history list is refused rather than raced

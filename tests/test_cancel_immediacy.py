"""``/cancel`` ends the turn where it stands.

Cancellation used to be a flag nobody watched. ``session.cancel_event`` is read
*between* actions, and everything slow lives inside one, so a cancel was only
ever as immediate as the current model or tool call — and for a streaming model
call it was not immediate at all, because a backend pushing tokens makes no
Request the kernel could refuse.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix. First that the *stoppers* exist and
reach the right thing: a session's interrupt registry, a brain evicting the box
it just killed, a sandbox cancelling only the runs belonging to one session.
Second, and just as load-bearing, that **nothing from the agent is rendered
after the cancel lands** — the narration, the ✕, the final reply, the tail
message and the whole extra turn the subagent barrier used to force.

The failure they guard against is silent in the worst direction: every one of
those paths looks like the system working, and the person is left watching an
agent they told to stop.

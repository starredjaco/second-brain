"""Tests for the agent-turn lifecycle bus events.

``_drive_agent_turn`` is the single site every agent turn flows through
(foreground ``handle_action`` and background ``iterate_agent_turn`` alike),
so SESSION_TURN_STARTED / SESSION_TURN_COMPLETED are emitted there — plus the
agent-side SESSION_TURN_CHANGED that mirrors what user actions already get
from the dispatch layer.
